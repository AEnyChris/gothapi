# gothapi
An API for Game of Thrones

This is an open API that provides data about the GOT Universe based on the TV series _Game of Thrones_ with an hope of expansion to cover _House of Dragons_ by HBO in subsequent versions.
The currently available resources, schema and the associated endpoints are described below.



### Authentication:
The API is an open API, hence no authentication is required. Consequently, the request method is restricted only to GET.

### Structure:

Resources:
The following are the resources covered:

- <strong>People</strong>: Characters as portrayed in the GOT and HOD series
- <strong>Houses</strong>: The ruling houses in Westeros
- <strong>Places</strong>: the places, the Countries, the house 
- <strong>Dragons</strong>: the dragons of Game of Thrones and House of Dragons
- <strong>Seasons</strong>: the seasons of Game of Thrones
- <strong>Episodes</strong>: The episodes of all seasons

### Endpoints:

        https://www.gothapi.com/api/ or 
        http://localhost:8000/api/

	
_Root_:

		https://www.gothapi.com/ or
        http://localhost:8000/

    }

_Stats_:

		https://www.gothapi.com/api/stats
The stats endpoint gives the statistics of all available resources: the resources and the number of each in the database at the time. The GOT Universe is vast, and all the data according to the series or books may not be available when this API goes live. However, more data will be continually added until we have traversed all of Westeros, Essos, Bravos, and beyond the known world (if Arya Stark does not beat us to it ðŸ™‚).
